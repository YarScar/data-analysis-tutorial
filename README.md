# Agentic Data Quality Analysis Platform (scaffold)

This is a minimal scaffolded Next.js (JavaScript) app created from the `data-analysis-tutorial` instructions.

Run locally:

```bash
# install dependencies (npm or pnpm)
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev

# build
npm run build

# start production
npm start
```

Environment variables:

- Create `.env.local` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` to enable AI insights.

This scaffold follows the requirements in `start_here.md`: Next.js App Router, React 18, plain JavaScript and CSS, PapaParse for CSV parsing, Chart.js for charts, and OpenAI integration hooks.
