/* Global CSS has been consolidated into src/styles/globals.css
   to keep all styles in the `styles` folder as requested.

   The real styles are in `src/styles/globals.css` now. This file remains
   only as a small placeholder so import paths referencing it don't break
   if tools expect it; actual rules live in src/styles.
